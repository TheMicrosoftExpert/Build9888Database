# This is the database of software I used in my Windows 10 Build 9888 video!
Anyone can download my software from this database and use it whether or not it is on Build 9888.
I never actually ended up using this database in my video. I was unable to access it via IE and I couldn't get a modern browser running to get it up. I couldn't use shared folders because Guest Additions wasn't installed.
